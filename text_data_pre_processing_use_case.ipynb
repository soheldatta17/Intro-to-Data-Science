The same principle applies to our daily wastes. \\nIn case you did not know it, Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. Actually, I would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nothing to be proud of. \\nWe waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. Also, as a nation, the United States generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. \\nIf you crunch these numbers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll come up with astonishing numbers. \\nPutting Waste to Work for Energy \\nIt was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. To follow this guy\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . \\nWe, the preppers, can help mitigate the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cdisaster\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. \\nBriquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 that are used to start a fire. The terms derives from the French language and it means \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cbrick.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\nBiomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. Traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re used as a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cgreen\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. \\nCurrently, almost half of the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. \\nCutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving   humans, right? \\nAny household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfuel briquettes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. \\nHow to Make the Briquettes \\nSo, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste. \\nIt\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. \\nAs a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. \\nThere are also commercially available presses. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll just have to look for them on the internet or in   \\nThe fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses. You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \\nYou can also use a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \\nBasically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. \\nHere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a cool idea about DIY-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container. The possibilities are basically endless. \\nVideo first seen on nobodyprepper . \\nHow to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps \\nStep 1 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 preparing the briquette mix \\nFor example, if you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective), you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. \\nIn the next step, you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009csoup\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d. This step is very important but it takes some time and you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to do it well. \\nTo speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. \\nThe simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. You can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll add to the flavor. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to use roughly 20% paper though \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the lesson to be taken home. \\nYou can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the paper\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s binding properties into the sawdust-mix. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. \\nIn the next step, you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. The mix must hold together if squeezed; that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s how you determine the ideal consistency. \\nStep 2 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 prepare the press \\nThis step depends on whether you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re using a cool home press or an improvised device. Let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s say you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re on the low-tech side and you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. \\nYou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. You can use a hot wire to burn the holes. \\nThen you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. Don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. \\nObviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. Ideally you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. Don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 otherwise, the water won\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t drain and you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re wasting your time. \\nStep 3 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 press the mix \\nIn this step, you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. Then you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. \\nPush as hard as you can \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 the harder the better. Then you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to pull the bag out of the mold and here\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s your first briquette, folks. \\nStep 4 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 dry your briquettes \\nBut it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s not over yet.

As she enumerated her many grievances, I couldn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t help thinking of the scene in Monty Python\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLife of Brian\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in which a bunch of disaffected Judeans sit around, complaining about the Romans. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThey\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve bled us white, the bastards,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d says their leader, Reg, played by John Cleese. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAnd what have they ever given us in return?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d His colleagues mention a few things, by way of example. O. K. Reg says. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBut apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the freshwater system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Even Britain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s most enthusiastic European Union supporters would not argue that Europe has been quite so helpful to their country, of course. But as chance would have it, Ms. O\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Neill was heaping her abuse on Europe in a spot that has been a particularly enthusiastic recipient of European largess over the years. So when she declared, of the European Union, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re subsidizing them, and what do we get out of it except for a load of laws that we don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t vote for?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d it was an easy question to answer. For one thing, there was the large building directly behind her, the Echo Arena and BT Convention Center. When the complex was built, in 2008, Europe kicked in 50 million pounds. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWell, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve never been to the Echo Arena,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Ms. O\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Neill said. Just as many Britons feel emotionally apart and even alien from Europe, so they see the European Union as an opaque, bewildering abstraction, a mysterious bureaucratic behemoth that hoovers up their money and independence while giving little (or nothing) in return. British understanding of its workings and purpose has not been helped by the    arguments being thrown around in the debate over the referendum, set for June 23. No one likes having this debate anyway, much less the unpleasantly       descriptions of its sides: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBrexit\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d (go) and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cRemain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d (stay). But underlying all the dire predictions of doom  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   that staying or going will cause Britain to fall apart in various apocalyptic ways  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   is a deeper emotional issue that speaks to the country\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s sense of self. Who does it think it is, and where does it think it belongs? Has it ever felt like it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s part of Europe? Separated from the Continent by language, tradition, historic antagonism and an inhospitable body of water, Britain has always seemed to be an uneasy participant in the wider European project. It took years to sign up, and its agreement was always marked by caveats and exceptions to the rules. Even when it did join, it felt to many Britons as if someone had given a British pub owner a bunch of fancy French Champagne bottles and said, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHere, use these for your British ale from now on. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d The trappings might be different, but the beer is still the same. In the 15 years I lived in London (I returned home to the United States three years ago) I was constantly struck by the sense of otherness with which many English people regarded Europeans. (It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s more complicated for Scots, whose mistrust of Britain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s   government makes them more   and for younger people and Londoners, who generally feel part of a wider world.) But travel around England, talking to older people, and you find below the surface a sense of unease, of distrust. Even people who believe that Britain should stay in the European Union, for economic and trading purposes, do not feel very European. At every turn, Britain proclaims its singularity. Most countries fly the European flag next to their national flags Britain doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t. Most of Europe uses euros Britain uses pounds. British airports have a passport line that says \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBritish and E. U. Passports. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d British politicians in the last 20 years have increasingly talked about British values and British traditions, about what sets Britons apart from Europeans rather than what they have in common. British people don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t speak the same language as other people in the European Union  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   not literally, not metaphorically. This is a country where one of the main railroad stations, Waterloo, commemorates Napoleon\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s defeat by the British, where a serious objection to building the Channel Tunnel was that it might encourage rabid animals to sneak in from France, and where Beauchamp Place in London is pronounced \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c . \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d The idea that things are easily lost in translation is reflected in the opening line of P. G. Wodehouse\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe Luck of the Bodkins,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d as a Briton confronts the daunting prospect of having to make himself understood on the Continent. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cInto the face of the young man who sat on the terrace of the Hotel Magnifique at Cannes,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Wodehouse writes, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthere had crept a look of furtive shame, the shifty, hangdog look which announces that an Englishman is about to talk French. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d The   special relationship with the United States isn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t providing much comfort to the Brexit side these days President Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s recent admonition to vote no in the referendum enraged many people who believe America should stay out of it and let their country think for itself. As for Europe, some of the British sense of dissonance comes from loss of empire and the country\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s complicated feelings about World War II, a moment that showed Britain at its shining best while simultaneously stripping it of its position as a major international power. And some of it stems, simply, from an   sense of otherness. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI might be part of the E. U. but I live on an island,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Alan Lyon, 49, who shovels cullet  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   broken glass  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   in a glass factory. Mr. Lyon\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s    lost both legs in World War I his grandfather fought in World War II. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe couldn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t mention Germany or France around him, he hated them so much,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. Britain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s populist tabloids have a long history of slipping happily into   remarks. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cUp Yours Delors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d read a famous headline in 1990 in The Sun, urging its readers to tell Jacques Delors, then the French head of the European Commission, to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfrog off. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d (Mr. Delors supported increased European economic integration, which The Sun did not.) Prince Harry once wore a Nazi commandant costume to a party. And in 2006, officials specifically warned fans traveling to Germany for a soccer match not to do things like shout \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cSieg heil\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d at the referees, or to put their fingers under their noses in a way meant to evoke Hitler\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s mustache. Perhaps the favorite television episode here is one on \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cFawlty Towers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d when a hotel owner, played (again) by Mr. Cleese, responds to a group of German guests by lapsing into xenophobic insanity,   around the dining room and referring to prawn cocktail as \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cprawn Goebbels. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cYou started it,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he says when the traumatized customers object. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cYou invaded Poland. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) The   side has tapped into   feeling by conflating the European migrant crisis with what many Britons see as a local immigration crisis caused by lax European laws and porous European borders. In their view, the country is being overrun by foreigners who not only take their jobs and welfare benefits, but also bring fundamentally different values into Britain. Recently, Britons were appalled at the news that a German comedian who went on television and recited a rude poem about Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, is to be prosecuted under a German law prohibiting the insulting of foreign leaders. As a way to thumb its nose at both Germany and Turkey, the influential   Spectator magazine started a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cPresident Erdogan Offensive Poetry\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d competition, inviting readers to submit   limericks. The winner was Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and leader of the Brexit campaign, who implied in his poem that Mr. Erdogan was overly fond of goats. Announcing the winner in the magazine, Douglas Murray, who organized the competition, said the existence of the poem (and of Mr. Johnson) showed Britain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s superiority over Germany, which is part of the European Union, and Turkey, which would like to be. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI think it a wonderful thing that a British political leader has shown that Britain will not bow before the putative caliph in Ankara,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cErdogan may imprison his opponents in Turkey. Chancellor Merkel may imprison Erdogan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s critics in Germany. But in Britain we still live and breathe free. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\",\n          \"This post was originally published on this site \\nMOSCOW, November 17. /TASS/.

The same principle applies to our daily wastes. \\nIn case you did not know it, Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. Actually, I would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nothing to be proud of. \\nWe waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. Also, as a nation, the United States generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. \\nIf you crunch these numbers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll come up with astonishing numbers. \\nPutting Waste to Work for Energy \\nIt was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. To follow this guy\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . \\nWe, the preppers, can help mitigate the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cdisaster\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. \\nBriquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 that are used to start a fire. The terms derives from the French language and it means \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cbrick.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\nBiomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. Traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re used as a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cgreen\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. \\nCurrently, almost half of the world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. \\nCutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving   humans, right? \\nAny household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfuel briquettes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. \\nHow to Make the Briquettes \\nSo, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste. \\nIt\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. \\nAs a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. \\nThere are also commercially available presses. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll just have to look for them on the internet or in   \\nThe fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses. You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \\nYou can also use a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \\nBasically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. \\nHere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a cool idea about DIY-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container. The possibilities are basically endless. \\nVideo first seen on nobodyprepper . \\nHow to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps \\nStep 1 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 preparing the briquette mix \\nFor example, if you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective), you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. \\nIn the next step, you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009csoup\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d. This step is very important but it takes some time and you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to do it well. \\nTo speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. \\nThe simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. You can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll add to the flavor. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to use roughly 20% paper though \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the lesson to be taken home. \\nYou can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the paper\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s binding properties into the sawdust-mix. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. \\nIn the next step, you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. The mix must hold together if squeezed; that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s how you determine the ideal consistency. \\nStep 2 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 prepare the press \\nThis step depends on whether you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re using a cool home press or an improvised device. Let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s say you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re on the low-tech side and you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. \\nYou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. You can use a hot wire to burn the holes. \\nThen you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. Don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. \\nObviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. Ideally you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. Don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 otherwise, the water won\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t drain and you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re wasting your time. \\nStep 3 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 press the mix \\nIn this step, you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. Then you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. \\nPush as hard as you can \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 the harder the better. Then you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to pull the bag out of the mold and here\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s your first briquette, folks. \\nStep 4 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 dry your briquettes \\nBut it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s not over yet. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to dry your briquettes for about a week outside in the sun. If they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re not properly dried, the briquettes will smoke when burned and that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s unpleasant to say the least. \\nIf you can\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t improvise a mold and/or a press, you can always make fuel-briquettes with just your hands, squeezing the mix in your bare hands and building fuel balls and you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have to dry these out too, obviously. \\nThere are so many survival things you can do by yourself.   discover   wood creations. \\n\\n  5 total views, 5 views today\",\n          \"WASHINGTON  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094     Donald J. Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan, breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods. The mandate  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   issued \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cwithout exceptions,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23, diplomats who saw it said  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   threatens to leave the United States without   envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain. In the past, administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a    basis to allow a handful of ambassadors, particularly those with   children, to remain in place for weeks or months. Mr. Trump, by contrast, has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cPolitical\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d ambassadors, many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president, almost always leave at the end of his term ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts. A senior Trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations, said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date. The directive has nonetheless upended the personal lives of many ambassadors, who are scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to remain in their countries so their children can remain in school, the diplomats said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter. In Costa Rica, Ambassador Stafford Fitzgerald Haney is hunting for a house or an apartment as his family  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   which includes four   children and his wife, who has been battling breast cancer  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   struggles to figure out how to avoid a move back to the United States with five months left in the school year, according to the diplomats. In the Czech Republic, they said, Ambassador Andrew H. Schapiro is seeking housing in Prague as well as lobbying his children\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s   school to break with policy and accept them back midyear. In Brussels and Geneva, Denise Bauer, the United States ambassador to Belgium, and Pamela Hamamoto, the permanent representative to the United Nations, are both trying to find a way to keep daughters from having to move just months before their high school graduation. Ronald E. Neumann, the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, a   nonprofit association for former ambassadors and senior diplomats, said it was reasonable to expect ambassadors to return at the end of a term, given that they are direct representatives of the president with broad grants of authority. But he could not recall an occasion on which such a strict timeline had been applied. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWhen you have people out there whose only reason for being an ambassador is their political connection to the outgoing president of a different party, it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s pretty logical to say they should leave,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Mr. Neumann, a career Foreign Service officer who held ambassadorships in Algeria, Bahrain and Afghanistan. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBut I don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t recollect there was ever a guillotine in January where it was just, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Everybody out of the pool immediately. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d W. Robert Pearson, a former ambassador to Turkey and a scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said the rule was \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cquite extraordinary,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d adding that it could undermine American interests and signal a hasty change in direction that exacerbates jitters among allies about their relationships with the new administration. With the world already primed to be worrying about such an abrupt change, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthis is just a very concrete signal that it is going to happen,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Mr. Pearson said. At a White House farewell reception that Mr. Obama held on Wednesday night for noncareer ambassadors, many of them commiserated, attendees said, comparing notes about how to handle the situation. Some expressed dismay that Mr. Trump, whose wife, Melania, has chosen to stay in New York to avoid moving the couple\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s    son, Barron, to a new school midyear, would not ensure that such allowances were made for American ambassadors. They are weighing a direct appeal to Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nominee for secretary of state, or other top transition officials to reconsider the policy. Derek Shearer, a professor of diplomacy at Occidental College who is a former United States ambassador to Finland, said it was difficult to see a rationale for the decision. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt feels like there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s an element just of spite and payback in it,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t see a higher policy motive. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d The State Department informed all politically appointed ambassadors in a letter the day after the election that they were to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20. It instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications. Incoming presidents of both parties have often made exceptions to allow ambassadors to wrap up personal affairs and important diplomatic business while their successors were in the confirmation process, which can take months. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Mr. Obama all granted extensions for a few politically appointed ambassadors. Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell offered particularly wide latitude to ambassadors facing family issues, said Marc Grossman, a longtime diplomat and former top State Department official who is vice chairman of the Cohen Group, a Washington consultancy. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThis was something that was important to Secretary Powell because of his own experience living and serving all over the world, so when people asked him, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Could I stay another couple of weeks, couple of months my kids are finishing school,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 he was very accommodating,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Mr. Grossman said, adding that his flexibility was an \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cexception\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d to the general practice. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHe was trying to, I think, send a message that family was important. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\",\n          \"WASHINGTON  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that people on the terror watch list should be barred from buying firearms, putting himself in the center of a   debate in Congress revived by the worst mass shooting in United States history. Mr. Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s stance, expressed in a Twitter post, does not necessarily jibe with the positions of the Republican Party and the National Rifle Association, whose endorsement Mr. Trump frequently boasts about on the campaign trail. His tweet could be read to support measures pushed by Democrats and opposed by Republicans in Congress, reflecting the unusual nuances of the issue, which touches on public safety and civil rights beyond the Second Amendment. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI will be meeting with the N. R. A. who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the   list, to buy guns,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, wrote Wednesday morning on Twitter. His comment came three days after 49 people were killed when a gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State stormed an Orlando nightclub. On the same morning, a group of Democrats took to the Senate floor in a filibuster to protest the lack of improvement in gun safety measures in recent years. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve had enough,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who spoke on and off for more than 14 hours. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI couldn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t just come back to the Senate this week and pretend like this is business as usual. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d When he finished talking shortly after 2 a. m. on Thursday, Mr. Murphy said he had secured agreement for votes on the measures. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am proud to announce that after 14+ hours on the floor, we will have a vote on closing the terror gap  universal background checks,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Mr. Murphy said in a Twitter message posted around 1:50 a. m. The filibuster drew significant attention online, with supporters tweeting support and encouragement as the hours dragged on. Mr. Murphy acknowledged that support after ending the filibuster. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThis would never have happened without you,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said in a separate Twitter post. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWithout your outpouring of support  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   your calls, tweets  emails. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d The Democratic legislation, sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, would seek to prevent individuals on the government\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s terror watch list from purchasing guns on the recommendation of the Justice Department alone. Ms. Feinstein unsuccessfully proposed a similar measure last year, after 14 people were killed by an Islamic extremist couple in San Bernardino, Calif. The legislation she is now proposing goes even further, covering not just people on the watch list at the time of purchase, but anyone who had been on the list in the preceding five years. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, had been on the list but was removed after an F. B. I. investigation turned up no evidence that he was plotting any crimes. N. R. A. officials said on Twitter that they would be happy to meet with Mr. Trump, but that the group had not changed its position: withholding guns from people on the terrorist watch list, the vast majority of whom have not been charged with a crime, would give the government too much power to deny people of their Second Amendment right. At one point in 2014, the list had 800, 000 names, and in the past famous Americans like Senator Ted Kennedy and Representative John Lewis had undergone additional screening at airports because their names were similar to those on the list. The group has supported a competing measure put forward by Republicans, led by Senator John Cornyn of Texas. Under the proposal, when someone on the watch list tried to buy a gun, federal prosecutors would have three days to persuade a judge that there is probable cause to deny the purchase. Democrats say that burden is too high. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe N. R. A. believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the group\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Institute for Legislative Action, in a statement. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAt the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow   Americans who are wrongly put on a watch list to be removed. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump confirmed that he met with Mr. Cox in New York on Tuesday, though the terror watch list was not on the agenda. Mr. Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s campaign did not clarify Wednesday how far his proposal would go or articulate which of the dueling measures  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   Mr. Cornyn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s or Ms. Feinstein\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   Mr. Trump most agrees with. Democrats were not counting on Mr. Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s support and almost seemed not to want it. They have been more than happy to associate him with the N. R. A. which Democrats view as the biggest obstacle to gun control. Republicans are under pressure to show some action in response to the Orlando shooting, and Mr. Cornyn said on Wednesday evening that he was working with Ms. Feinstein on a potential compromise. But Ms. Feinstein, speaking to reporters after a classified briefing on the Orlando shooting that Mr. Cornyn also attended, said she doubted a deal would be reached. As for Mr. Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s role, she was dismissive. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cOh, Trump just makes everything worse,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Ms. Feinstein said. During the primaries, Mr. Trump, who is a gun owner, spoke often about his affinity for guns as a way to prove his conservatism. He is in step with the N. R. A. on virtually all other gun issues, including his opposition to a ban on assault weapons. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBy the way, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m going to save your Second Amendment,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said Wednesday at a rally in Atlanta. As he has after other mass shootings, Mr. Trump said Wednesday that more gun ownership was the answer, not less. He said that the carnage could have been minimized \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cif some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle, and if the bullets were going in the other direction. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Actual floor debate on any of the proposals in Congress was not expected until Thursday at the earliest. Mr. Murphy was aided by a large cast of Democrats but especially his fellow Connecticut senator, Richard Blumenthal, as well as Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the minority whip. They yielded briefly for questions from Republicans but otherwise talked incessantly about the need for tighter gun control. By early evening, the Democrats brought out a poster showing photographs of victims of the Orlando shooting. Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, stood next to the poster, reading out the victims\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 names and speaking about their lives. A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said that the speechmaking by Democrats was merely delaying the consideration of the   measures, as well as proposals on F.
